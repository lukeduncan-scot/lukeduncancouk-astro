## Numbers & Entropy

On a whim, I thought it might be interesting to create a small program in Kotlin to generate an infinite stream of numbers. Just for the sake of watching the entropy unfold. 

Here’s the prototype so far:

```kotlin
import com.github.ajalt.clikt.core.CliktCommand
import com.github.ajalt.clikt.core.main
import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.flow
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
import kotlin.random.Random

class Hello : CliktCommand() {
    override fun run() {
        // 1. Define the infinite stream
        val randomNumFlow = flow {
            while (true) {
                emit(Random.nextInt(0, Int.MAX_VALUE))
                delay(1000) // One drop of entropy per second
            }
        }

        runBlocking {
            randomNumFlow.collect { value ->
                println("Generated: $value")
            }
        }
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) = Hello().main(args)
```

## Clikt
As you can see from the code sample, I am using a library to build the command-line interface. Since my main goal is just to see the numbers flow, I didn't want to overcomplicate the setup.

I’m using Clikt, which makes CLI creation in Kotlin almost effortless. It handles the boilerplate so I can focus on the logic.

### Future Plans
From what I understand about Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs), they rely on the entropy services provided by the Operating System. While they’re functionally random for most tasks, they aren't "true" randomness.

I have some ideas on how to introduce a bit of chaos and tap into "true randomness," but I’ll save that rabbit hole for a future post.
