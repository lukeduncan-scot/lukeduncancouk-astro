Welcome to my new blog powered by **merox-erudite**!

## 2026 is THE year

I'm starting this year off by catching up on Android development. 
I've been on hiatus for too long. When I last worked professionally, Jetpack Compose was a twinkle in the eye of the Android team, so I'm picking myself up by my bootstraps and catching up.
